    "Online food delivery has become a huge part of how we eat today. It's not just about convenience anymore; for many people, it's an everyday necessity. The industry is growing fast, about 9% each year, and could be worth nearly $2 trillion by 2029 according to recent research (Mohamadabadi et al., 2024). One of the most important things customers look at when ordering is the star rating. Research shows people trust these ratings almost as much as personal recommendations (Selvaraj & Nallasivam, 2023).\n",
    "\n",
    "This got us thinking: Could we predict a restaurant's star rating just by looking at basic information like its price range, how many reviews it has, how far it delivers, and what city it's in? Using real data from DoorDash in Canada, we're trying to build a model that does exactly that. We're not trying to figure out why certain restaurants get better ratings (that would require different methods), but rather see if we can make accurate predictions based on what we can observe.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach builds on what we know from previous studies about how important ratings are in food delivery apps, while focusing on a practical prediction problem that could help both the platforms and restaurant owners. The idea is that if we can predict ratings well, it might help restaurants understand what factors matter most to customers, and help platforms improve their recommendation systems."
